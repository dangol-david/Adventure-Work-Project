## Overview
Adventure Works is a large multinational company that manufactures and distributes 4 categories of products: bikes, bike components, accessories, and clothing.

## Problem Statement
In the Adventure Work project, the responsibility is to transform raw data into insightful reports and dashboards. These tools enable the management team to monitor KPIs, compare regional performance, analyze product trends, and identify high-value customers. This work empowers the team to make informed decisions and optimize business strategies based on these valuable insights.

## Process
 ```Data Cleaning and Transformation```
 
The data, collected from a Udemy course, was carefully cleaned using Power Query in Power BI. This cleaning process involved fixing missing, repeated, and messy values to make sure the data was accurate. New columns were added, and tables were combined for a better understanding of the information.

```Building Relationship```

After cleaning the data in Power Query, the cleaned data was loaded. In the Model view, relationships were established among the tables. This step was important to create unbiased visualizations based on accurate and cleaned data.The primary key was carefully chosen, and the foreign keys were hidden to ensure unbiased visualizations without any removed information. This approach guarantees that the visual representations are accurate and fair, reflecting the true insights from the data.




```Table View```

In the table view, we selected specific data categories for columns to display the right formats. For instance, in the "Territory" category, we chose the "Country" column from the data category to ensure accurate visualizations, matching the correct countries in the data.

```Report View```

Special calculations called DAX measures were used to find the real KPIs and assist in creating charts like graphs, lines, and bars. These charts show important information in an easy-to-understand way.An interactive dashboard was developed, offering users the capability to filter and visualize data seamlessly. This user-friendly interface enhances the overall experience, allowing users to explore the data, apply filters, and gain valuable insights effortlessly.


## Dashboard

- Bookmarks are Utilized in the Dashboard, which is convenient to switch between sheets.
- It includes various filters for exploring different scenarios.
- Customized tooltip has been created in order to get the in deep details about the products.
- The hierarchy has been added to drill down inside the sheet.
- There are 4 sheets has been created to get in deep details, the Dashboard,product details,map and the customer details.

## Challenges Faced 

``` Creating  Measures``` 

Creating the measures that is essential for the visualization was crucial and the most challenging problem I have faced while building this project.To make sure building the essential measure in order to make the visualization more in depth and help the managers to find out the key findings easily.


## Learnings

``Data Quality Importance``

The project reinforced the critical importance of data quality. Clean and accurate data is foundational for meaningful analysis and actionable insights.

``Real-World Application``

The project demonstrated how data analysis can directly impact organizational decision-making and lead to actionable strategies for addressing critical challenges.

``Effective Visualizaion`` 

Effective visualization,showing the important and in depth visualization according to the viewers is crucial. It helps to build a dashboard with the things that they need to know .
